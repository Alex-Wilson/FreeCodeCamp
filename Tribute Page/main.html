      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Sir Francis Bacon's life:</h3>
      <ul id="time-line">
        <li><strong>1561</strong> - Born in London, England to a family of Nobles</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1573</strong> -At just 12 years old Bacon was accepted into the prestigious
          Trinity College at the University of Cambridge where he pursued an education in religion
          and philosophy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1576</strong> - Bacon began to feel that there were fundamental issues with the way that
          "natural philosophy" was being taught. Bacon's respect for Aristotle conflicted with his rejection of  
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism target="_blank"> Aristotelianism</a>. After graduating, 
          Bacon would be accepted into the Gray's Inn college to become a lord and adjudicator, only to leave the country
          shortly after to travel and learn under the guidance of Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador to France.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1579</strong> - Upon learning of the death of his father, Bacon returns home to learn that he would not get
          the full inheritance he thought he would receive, as it was to be split by all his father's heirs. Completing his time at Gray's Inn
          would lead Bacon into debt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1581</strong> - Bacon campaigns and wins his general election to become a member of Parliament for Cornwall. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1586</strong> - Bacon was labeled a reformist and progressive for advocated for the freedom
          of religion for puritans, despite the fact he also called for the execution of the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1603</strong> - Bacon is knighted for his allegiance to King James I. Bacon continues support but only
          because he remained in debt.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1613</strong> - Bacon finishes his term as the MP for Cambridge before being appointed Attorney General of
          England.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1618</strong> - Bacon achieves what has been a life dream and attains the title of Lord Chancellor.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1620</strong> - Far ahead of his time, Bacon publishes his seminal work
           <i>Novum Organum, sive Indicia Vera de Interpretati interpretation of one Naturae</i> meaning
          "true directions concerning the nature". Bacon lays the foundation of empiricism, using evidence and not intuition or ethics,
          to learn about the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1621</strong> - Bacon is convicted on charges of bribery and corruption. He is 
          sentenced to prison but King James pardons him. He can no longer hold public office as he is now
          a criminal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1626</strong> - Francis bacon died of pneumonia while studying the effects of freezing temperatures
          on the preservation of meat. 
        </li>

          “Bacon first taught the world the true method of the study of nature, and rescued science from that
          barbarism in which the followers of Aristotle, by a too servile imitation of their master, had involved it.”
